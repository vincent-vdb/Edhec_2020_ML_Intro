    ">\n",
    "> An additional branch of machine learning is **reinforcement learning (RL)**. Reinforcement learning differs from other types of machine learning. In RL you don't collect examples with labels. Imagine you want to teach a machine to play a very basic video game and never lose. You set up the model (often called an **agent** in RL) with the game, and you tell the model not to get a \"game over\" screen. During training, the agent receives a **reward** when it performs this task, which is called a **reward function**. With reinforcement learning, the agent can learn very quickly how to outperform humans.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The lack of a data requirement makes RL a tempting approach. However, designing a good reward function is difficult, and RL models are less stable and predictable than supervised approaches. Additionally, you need to provide a way for the agent to interact with the game to produce data, which means either building a physical agent that can interact with the real world or a virtual agent and a virtual world, either of which is a big challenge.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Reinforcement learning is an active field of ML research, but in this course we'll focus on the problems detailed above because they're a better known problem, more stable, and result in a simpler system.\n",
