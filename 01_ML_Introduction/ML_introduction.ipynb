Another way to think of classification is as a discrete (as opposed to continuous) form of supervised learning where one has a limited number of categories and for each of the n samples provided, one is trying to label them with the correct category or class.\n",

The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called **clustering**, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization, called **dimensionality reduction**.\n"

    "> An additional branch of machine learning is **reinforcement learning (RL)**. Reinforcement learning differs from other types of machine learning. In RL you don't collect examples with labels. Imagine you want to teach a machine to play a very basic video game and never lose. You set up the model (often called an **agent** in RL) with the game, and you tell the model not to get a \"game over\" screen. During training, the agent receives a **reward** when it performs this task, which is called a **reward function**. With reinforcement learning, the agent can learn very quickly how to outperform humans.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The lack of a data requirement makes RL a tempting approach. However, designing a good reward function is difficult, and RL models are less stable and predictable than supervised approaches. Additionally, you need to provide a way for the agent to interact with the game to produce data, which means either building a physical agent that can interact with the real world or a virtual agent and a virtual world, either of which is a big challenge.\n",
